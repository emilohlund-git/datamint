# Usage Examples

There are a few scenarios where `Datamint` can be useful for you.

## Testing with Mock Data

One of the most common use cases for `Datamint` is in testing environments where you need to mock data
into a real database. Instead of manually settings up a database and populating it with mock data, you can use
`Datamint` to automate this process. This not only saves you time but also ensures that your tests are always
running against the most up-to-date version of your database schema.

## Docker Container Management

`Datamint` also simplifies the process of managing Docker containers for your databases. With `Datamint`, you can easily spin up Docker containers before a test suite and tear them down afterwards. This "automagical" process ensures that each test suite runs in a clean environment, reducing the risk of tests interfering with each other and improving the reliability of your test suites.

## Easy Database Setup for Small Applications

While not it&apos;s primary intended use case, `Datamint` can also be used to quickly set up databases for smaller applications.
Although this is not recommended for larger, more complex applications, it can be a convenient solution for smaller proejcts that don&apos;t
require a full-fledged database management system.

## Full Control Over Database Connections

With `Datamint`, you have full control over the lifecycle of your database connections. You can manually spin up and tear down containers as needed, giving you
the flexibility to manage your database connections in a way that best suits your application&apos;s needs. Whether you&apos;re running a complex test suite or simply need a quick
and easy way to set up a database for a small application, `Datamint` gives you the tools you need to manage your databases effectively and efficiently.
