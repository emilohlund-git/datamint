# Getting Started with Datamint

Welcome to the getting started guide for Datamint! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and tearing down Dockerized databases using Datamint.

## Setting Up a Dockerized Database

Let's start by setting up a Dockerized PostgreSQL database. Here's how you can do it:

```ts
import { Datamint, DatabaseType } from "datamint";

const config = {
  name: "test",
  user: "testuser",
  password: "password",
};

const mint = new Datamint(DatabaseType.POSTGRESQL, config);

await mint.start();
```

### Under the Hood

Datamint will parse the configs to a docker-compose file and spin up a temporary container with the config options.

In this case, since we're using a Postgres image, on localhost:5432. Under the hood Datamint also uses the Docker
variables to generate a connection string to connect to the container.

## Tearing Down a Dockerized Database

After you're done with your tests, you can tear down the Dockerized database like this:

```ts
await mint.stop();
```

This will start an asynchronous operation that will not resolve until the temporary files regarding the docker instance,
alongside the temporary containers are brought down. Should there be any errors there are plenty of listeners making sure
that the resources are brought down gracefully.

## Next Steps

Congratulations, you've just set up and torn down your first Dockerized database with Datamint! From here, you can start using Datamint in your test suites. Check out the [Usage Examples](usage-examples.mdx) page to see how you can use Datamint with Jest.
