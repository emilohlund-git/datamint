# Datamint Class

The `Datamint` class is a part of the Datamint library. It extends the `Observer` class and is responsible for managing a Docker container for a specific database.

## Properties

- `dockerManager`: An instance of the `DockerManager` class. It's responsible for managing the Docker container.
- `fileProcessor`: An instance of the `FileProcessor` class. It's responsible for processing the files related to the Docker container.

## Constructor

The constructor for the `Datamint` class takes two parameters:

- `database`: A `DatabaseType` enum. It specifies the type of database that the `Datamint` class will manage.
- `options`: A `DatabaseOptions` object that contains the options for the database.

Example:

```typescript
const datamint = new Datamint(DatabaseType.MYSQL, {
  /* options */
});
```

## Methods

`update()`

This asynchronous method gets called when the `Datamint` class is notified of a change. When called it will await the `dockerManager` to stop the container, the `fileProcessor` to process the files, and then gracefully exit the process.

`start()`

This asynchronous method starts the Docker container.

`stop()`

This asynchronous method stops the Docker container.

`gracefulShutdown()`

This protected asynchronous method gracefully shuts down the Docker container if the `Datamint` instance is no longer needed. It removes the instance from the `DatamintManager`, cleans up temporary directories if there are no more `Datamint` instances, and stops the Docker container.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `Datamint` class:

```typescript
const datamint = new Datamint(DatabaseType.MYSQL, {
  /* options */
});

// Start the Docker container
await datamint.start();

// Do something with the database

// Stop the Docker container
await datamint.stop();
```

Remember to replace `{ /* options */ }` with the appropriate options for the database you want to manage.
